### Hey there, folks ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ My name is Dustin Ballentine, and I have recently transitioned from a career as a US Army Engineer Officer into the world of Data Science. I focus mostly on implementation of machine learning algorithms using python and SQL for knowledge discovery and business value generation. 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently focusing on my skills in defining and framing ML problems and solutions, coding said solutions in python, deploying models into production through CI/CD pipelines on Google Cloud Platform, and applying MLOps to build kubeflow pipelines in Google Vertex AI.

ðŸ“« You can find me on LinkedIn @DABallentine.

Until then...thank you all for collaboratively sharing what you know, and here's to a lifelong commitment to learning ðŸ¥‚.
